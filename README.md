# Raspberry-Pi-3-master

You need to have Python interpreter on your Raspberry and following libraries:

Adafruit_DHT, RPi.GPIO (or any other for the sensors)
<br>datetime
<br>email.mime.multipart
<br>email.mime.text
<br>h5py
<br>json
<br>math
<br>os
<br>requests
<br>shutil
<br>smtplib
<br>socket
<br>time

1. Copy all files to a directory on your Raspberry Pi 3
2. Create your own configuration file (config10.36.5.157.json is an example)
3. Run "python client.py &" to check, when the configuration file is updated on server.
4. Run "python main.py" to start the main program.
